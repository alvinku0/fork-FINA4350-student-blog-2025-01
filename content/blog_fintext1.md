## Introduction

Data retrieval is the process of extracting relevant textual information from large datasets or databases. It's a crucial first step in many NLP workflows. By harnessing the power of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), you can request data on-demand to fuel various analytical endeavors.

In this post, we'll explore fundamental strategies for collecting data through APIs. We'll also walk through sample code on data retrieval and discuss how can we handle large datasets.

## Simple Data Retrieval using AРІ

If you're new to APIs, this simple demonstration can help you quickly understand data retrieval using API. Taking Alpha Vantage API as an example, we use Python's requests library to get news articles for Apple (AAPL).

``` Python
import requests
url='https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=NEWS_SENTIMENT&tickers=AAPL&apikey=demo'
data=requests.get(url).json()
print(data)
```

## Prints Data in a Nicely Formatted Way

Exploring your data using printed output is a great way to understand the structure before moving on to further analysis or storage. Python provides this handy pprint module for easier readability:

``` Python
import pprint
pp=pprint.PrettyPrinter()
pp.pprint(data)
```

This improves readability by neatly formatting nested data structures, making debugging and exploration simpler.

## Dealing with Big Data

Many APIs allow you to fetch large datasets, but they often impose limits such as the response sizes. To deal with these constraints, you often need to make repeated calls, iterating through available pages or date ranges. Below is a sample pseudocode illustrating how you can handle paginated data collection:

``` Pseudocode
Pseudocode

URL = "https://api.example.com/data"
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

data = []

loop through every date:
    loop through every page:
        response = request(URL, API_KEY, current_date, current_page)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data.append(response.json())
```

When dealing with extensive datasets, waiting on each page or date sequentially can slow you down. You can speed up this process using asynchronous programming, which lets you request multiple pages or date ranges concurrently.

``` Pseudocode
Pseudocode

async def fetch_data():
    do something
```

## Converting to a Pandas DataFrame

After collecting data from your API, one common next step is to convert that data into a Pandas DataFrame. Pandas is a powerful Python library for data cleaning, transformation and exploration.

Assuming your API returns in JSON format, you can convert it using this code snippet:

``` Python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.head()
```

## Saving Data into Permanent Storage

After collecting your data, consider storing it in a permanent format for future analysis. Depending on your project requirements, you can save to in different formats such as Parquet, CSV, Excel:

``` Python
df to_parquet('filename.parquet') # Efficient columnar storage
df.to_csv('filename.csv') # Widely compatible format: comma-separated values
df.to_excel('filename.xlsx') # Excel spreadsheet
```

Now you are ready to process the data, have fun with your NLP journey!
